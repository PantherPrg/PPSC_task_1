# PPSC_task_1: Lunch Punishment
**| difficulty: 1/10 |**

Oh no! You've been caught sleeping in science class and your teacher decides to assign you a punishment to receive during lunch. He makes you write "I, [name], am sorry for sleeping in class." a number of [times] (on seperate lines, of course). But, you're a programmer, so using your skills, you cheat the system. 

**Make sure to put another newline at the end of your returned result, otherwise it will not pass the testcase.*

_________________________________________________________________________________
This problem explores the topic of string multiplication, string concatentation, and newlines.

**optional challenge: complete in under 3 lines**

For additional help, either ask Paul, Joshua, Mr. Blattner, or any other staff member for assistance.

Otherwise, you can search up "python string concatenation", "python string multiplication", and "python string newlines".
